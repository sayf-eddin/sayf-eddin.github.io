about:
  - >
      My personal mission is to give to society through technology. 
      I am always eager to learn and often become obsessed with accomplishing tasks — the more 
      difficult the better. Within my various endeavors, I spend my time working on projects alone 
      and closely collaborating. I am constantly looking for ways to improve myself and help 
      those&nbsp;around&nbsp;me.
  - >
      I love exercising my creativity by playing guitar or painting, especially with 
      friends. I also enjoy going outside to play soccer or for a long hike.
